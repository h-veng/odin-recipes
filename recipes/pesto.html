      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        I went to eat at <a href="https://www.crownsydney.com.au/indulge/amare">
        a'Mare</a> with my parents for their 25th Anniversary where I ordered
        their Trofie al Pesto dish. They made pesto right on the spot and I was
        captivated so I decided that I'd give it a go. I used 
        <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/fresh_basil_pesto/"> this
        recipe</a> from Simply Recipes as a base and adapted it to use the
        ingredients that a'Mare used.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Basil leaves, 2 cups</li>
        <li>Pine nuts, 1/4 cup</li>
        <li>Macademia nuts, 1/4 cup</li>
        <li>Garlic, 3 cloves</li>
        <li>Olive oil, 3 tablespoons (adjust as necessary)</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese (optional, skip if freezing), grated, to taste</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="method">
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>With the flat side of the knife, crush each clove of garlic.</li>
        <li>
          In a pan (I use stainless steel), toast the garlic, pine nuts
          and macademia nuts successively until golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a mortar and pestle, grind the toasted garlic, pine nuts
          and macademia nuts until it becomes a paste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scoop out all the paste so there is no (or very little) of the nut
          paste left in the mortar and on the pestle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the same mortar and pestle, crush the basil leaves (do a bit
          at a time if you have a small mortar), until the leaves are broken
          up into tiny pieces (don't have to be precise).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the nut paste and the cheese into the mortar and crush and
          combine with the basil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the olive oil, salt, and pepper and combine.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fresh pesto is said to last about a week. Store with no contact with
          the air for best results. One way this could be achieved is to store
          the pesto in a bowl and use cling wrap; have the cling wrap go all
          the way down, touching the pesto.
        </li>
        <li>
          To freeze, put pesto in a ziplock bag, extract all the air, then seal
          and put in the freezer. Skip on the cheese if freezing. The pesto
          should be able to last in the freezer for up to 6 months.
