      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Fish sauce is sort of a staple in my childhood household. I have
        distinct memories of my mum saying one day when we went to a
        vietnamese restaurant: "The sauce is the most important part of the
        dish. If the sauce isn't good, the dish won't taste good."
      </p>
      <p>
        This fish sauce goes with a lot of dishes: banh xeo, vietnamese
        spring rolls, fried drop noodles, vermicelli salad, etc. The issue
        is that everyone makes it differently. It really is a matter of
        preference. This version of the recipe is my mum's and I prefer it
        over every other fish sauce I've tried at restaurants.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      Note: I use numbers by itself here for most things. This is because
      mum loved to keep it as a ratio and change the base measurement
      depending on how much fish sauce we need at the time. So how this
      works is if the base measurement is 1/2 a cup, the recipe calls
      for 2 sugar and 5 water. Thus, 2 &#215 1/2 cups of sugar and 5 &#215
      1/2 cups of water.
      <ul>
        <li>Sugar, 2</li>
        <li>Water, 5</li>
        <li>Squid Brand fish sauce, 1</li>
        <li>Lime juice, 1 (can substitute for other acids, measurement will
          vary)</li>
        <li>Garlic, minced, 1/2 tablespoon for every 1/2 cup base (doesn't
          have to be exact)</li>
        <li>Shallots, sliced, 1 tablespoon for every 1/2 cup base (doesn't
          have to be exact)</li>
        <li>Pink Himalayan Salt, 1 heaped teaspoon for every 1/2 cup base
          (measurement will vary if using a different salt)</li>
        <li>Crushed peanuts, as much as you want</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Put the sugar into a saucepan and add a 1/2 base of water to start
          hydrating the sugar (water is separate from the 5 water measured
          above).
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the saucepan on the stove at high heat and continually stir
          until sugar turns amber (DO NOT caramelise dark). Adjust 
          temperature as necessary according to bubbling. The sugar when
          scooped and drizzling back into the saucepan should resemble a
          spiderweb strand.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn the heat off and SLOWLY add the 5 water. Turn the heat back
          on and stir until the syrup starts boiling again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn the heat off and set aside to cool. For best results, leave
          for half a day for the flavours to sink in.
        </li>
        <li>Add the Squid Brand fish sauce into the saucepan and stir.</li>
        <li>Separate 3/4 of the lime juice.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and sliced shallots to the 3/4 lime juice.
          </li>
        <li>Add the lime juice mixture to the saucepan and stir.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust flavour as necessary (with salt and remaining
          lime juice).</li>
        <li>When serving, use a ladle to scoop the fish sauce into a bowl
          and add crushed peanuts to taste.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fish sauce keeps for a couple weeks but best to use fresh.</li>
