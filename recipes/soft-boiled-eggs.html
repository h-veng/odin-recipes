      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Whenever I go to a ramen restaurant, I always get the half-boiled
          egg. Now, I have absolutely no idea how to do a half boiled egg
          but I have discovered how to consistently make soft boiled eggs
          with a runny yolk.
        </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Eggs, how many ever you want</li>
          <li>Ice</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Pour water into a pot, enough to cover the eggs if they were 
            in the pot. (DO NOT put the eggs in yet)</li>
          <li>Bring the water to a boil</li>
          <li>Gently lower the eggs into the pot and boil uncovered for 4
            minutes</li>
          <li>Cover with the lid and turn off the heat.</li>
          <li>Leave for 2 minutes; prepare a cold water bath while waiting</li>
          <li>Take the eggs out of the water and transfer into the cold water
            bath.</li>
        </ol>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Results may vary depending on the eggs used. Especially if they
            have just come out of the fridge or if they were at room
            temperature. The eggs I use generally come straight out of the
            fridge.
