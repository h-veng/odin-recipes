      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever I go to a ramen restaurant, I always get the half-boiled
        egg. Now, I have absolutely no idea how to do a half boiled egg
        but I have discovered how to consistently make soft boiled eggs
        with a runny yolk.

          Results may vary depending on the eggs used. Especially if they
          have just come out of the fridge or if they were at room
          temperature. The eggs I use generally come straight out of the
          fridge.
